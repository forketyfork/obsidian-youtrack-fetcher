## Development Environment

This project supports two development workflows:

### Just Commands (Recommended)

If you're using the Nix development environment (via `nix develop` or direnv), use these Just commands:

- `just` - List all available commands
- `just clean` - Clean build artifacts and dependencies
- `just install` - Install dependencies
- `just build` - Full production build (includes tests, typecheck and formatting)
- `just dev` - Development build
- `just watch` - Development build with watch mode
- `just prod` - Production build without tests or type checking
- `just typecheck` - TypeScript typecheck
- `just format` - Format code with Prettier
- `just lint` - Check code style with ESLint
- `just test` - Run Jest tests
- `just test-dev` - Run development build and then tests
- `just test-watch` - Run development build and then tests in watch mode
- `just coverage` - Generate test coverage report
- `just build-css` - Minify CSS with CSSO (from src/styles.src.css to styles.css)
- `just version` - Bump version in manifest.json and versions.json
- `just release` - Full release (version, push, tags)

### Yarn Commands (Alternative)

- `yarn dev` - Development build
- `yarn dev:watch` - Development build with watch mode
- `yarn prod` - Production build without tests or type checking
- `yarn typecheck` â€” TypeScript typecheck
- `yarn format` - Format code with Prettier
- `yarn lint` - Check code style with ESLint
- `yarn test` - Run Jest tests
- `yarn test:dev` - Run development build and then tests
- `yarn test:watch` - Run development build and then tests in watch mode
- `yarn build` - Production build (includes tests, typecheck and formatting)
- `yarn build:css` - Minify CSS with CSSO (from src/styles.src.css to styles.css)
- `yarn version` - Bump version in manifest.json and versions.json

## General guidelines

- IMPORTANT: After finishing your task, make sure to run `just build` (if using Nix/Just) or `yarn build` and fix any introduced issues.
- IMPORTANT: On finishing your task, make sure the README.md file is up to date with regards to the new features, usage, and development.
- IMPORTANT: Always try to extract testable logic that can be independent of Obsidian plugins to separate classes or functions and write unit tests for it.
- IMPORTANT: Do not write useless tests just to increase coverage, make them actually useful for catching issues in the code.

## Typescript & Testing

- Strict null checks required (strictNullChecks: true)
- No implicit any values (noImplicitAny: true)
- Run type check with `yarn typecheck`
- ESLint is configured with typescript-eslint plugin
- Testing is done with Jest (`yarn test:dev`); make sure to always run the build before running the tests (`yarn test:dev` already takes care of that)
- All tests are in the `__tests__` directory
- Test files should end with `.test.ts`

## Code Style

- All source code (TypeScript, CSS, tests, mocks) should reside in the src directory.
- Avoid useless comments, use them to communicate obscure things and intentions which are not clear from the code rather than obvious details
- Use Obsidian API imports from a single import statement
- Use interfaces for type definitions
- Add explicit error handling with try/catch blocks
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Error messages should be user-friendly
- Avoid unnecessary logging to the console, no debug messages, only actual errors using console.error()
- Use consistent indentation (tabs) and spacing
- Class methods order: lifecycle methods first, then functionality
- Any text in UI elements should use "Sentence case" instead of "Title Case"
- Avoid committing changes in `yarn.lock` if you didn't change the `package.json` file, reset the `yarn.lock` file instead
- Avoid committing package-lock.json, since we use yarn; if this file is created as a result of your actions, remove it
- **Create separate files for new classes**: As a rule, add new classes as separate files unless they are tightly coupled to existing code

## CSS Best Practices

- All CSS classes should have the prefix `youtrack-fetcher-`.
- All user data attributes should start with `data-youtrack-fetcher-`
- Do not overwrite Obsidian core styling, always use custom classes or data attributes.

## Obsidian API Best Practices

- **Prefer metadata cache over file I/O**: Use `app.metadataCache.getFileCache(file)` instead of reading files with `app.vault.read()`
- **Use cached read from the vault** when not intending to change the file: `app.vault.cachedRead()` instead of `app.vault.read()`
- **Use efficient file queries**: Prefer `app.vault.getMarkdownFiles()` with filtering over folder traversal when working with multiple files
- **Use Map for caching**: When caching file data, use `Map<string, T>` with file paths as keys for efficient updates and deletions
- **SECURITY**: Using `innerHTML`, `outerHTML` or similar API's is a security risk. Instead, use the DOM API or the Obsidian helper functions, e.g. `book.createEl('div', { text: 'How to Take Smart Notes', cls: 'book__title' });`
- **Component lifecycle**: Register plugin sub-components with `this.addChild` and implement `onload`/`onunload` in those classes for cleanup
- **Path sanitization**: Use `normalizePath` to sanitize user provided paths before using them
- **Vault API**: Prefer the Vault API (`app.vault`) over direct adapter access
- **Network requests**: Use `requestUrl` for external HTTP requests instead of `fetch`
- **User input**: When letting users select files or folders, provide an `AbstractInputSuggest` for type-ahead support
- **Type safety**: Always validate and coerce types from frontmatter and user input (e.g., `String(value)` for frontmatter fields that might not be strings)
- **Component pattern**: Extend `Component` class for plugin sub-components to ensure proper cleanup and lifecycle management
